Holding the quality policy tightly, MHEL has set up and carried out an indigenous quality Management System (QMS) all around and has got the satisfaction and respect of its customers.",
      "We are using the latest technology to improve the machine quality as well as boring machines for efficiency and ease of the entire production process in general. Our aim is to have the ability to bring a higher level of efficiency to crushing projects in more ways than one. One of the great advantages of using a boring head with a single point tool is its ability to establish the true position of a hole or a series of holes. This is possible only because a single point tool can remove more stock from one side of a hole than the other.",
      "We use CNC cutting because the digital template and autonomous machining of CNC practically eliminate human error and achieves accuracy within 1/1000th.",
      "Usually, the manual plasma cutting process is quite accurate and precise based on the measurements given. The plasma cutter is equipped with gears that ensure that the cutting is accurate without deviating from the measurements specified. However, in the case of CNC plasma cutters, they are computer operated and are paired with state-of-the-art software. The specifications are stored in the hard disk of the computer before the cutting process begins. And once the cutter is computer operated, the cuts are sharp and clean. This ensures higher precision and accuracy in the entire cutting process.",
      "We use CNC computerized lathe machine and the main advantage is that it makes difficult jobs easier and quicker as it is fully automated with a computer program. The operator has to feed in the dimensions of the finished product in the specified program of the machine and then it does its job by finishing one process after another automatically, with an extreme level of accuracy and speed.",
      "We use the heat treatment process because steel parts often require some form of heat treatment to achieve an increase in hardness and obtain maximum strength and durability. Through the many different processes of heat treatment, the properties of steel are changed via physical and mechanical channels. As an added benefit, heat treatment can also aid in the manufacturing process. When we talk about change of mechanical properties, we're referring to the shear strength, toughness and tensile strength of the steel. Allowing for this mechanical change in properties enables your product to be more efficient in its daily duties and more resistant to wear and tear during even its toughest jobs.",
      "We use MIG welding because it provides excellent weld joint penetration and makes weld splatter and flux clean up quite simple. Flux cored wires provide a good middle ground between solid cored wires and self-shielded flux cored wires."
